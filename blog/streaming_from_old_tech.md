As 2022 rolls around, I began to ditch my imac in favour of my old hp running debian. I started to get requests to turn my camera on while video conferencing, or even calling my relatives. Up till now, I have been content with the built-in webcam: it looks grainy, blueish, and pixelated, which I'm a fan of. In this blog, I will document my process in making my setup even more absurd.

Rationale? Here are some of it:
- Matt Johnson's films, after watching some of his works, I was after the old look, especially the VHS/miniDV look of his films.
- And countless other japanese/russian old movies.
- Lastly, I wanted to put the old camcorder into good use.

My camera is the Panasonic PV GS65, and it also comprises a mini USB port. So naturally, I was thinking: Camcorder + mini USB + laptop = webcam?

There is one problem, however. My camcorder came out in a time when people still uses tapes as their main medium. And mini USB is only suitable for transferfing images. With video, you have to use Firewire cables (remember this thing?)
