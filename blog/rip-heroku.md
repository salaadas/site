Heroku is an online hosting service where you can push your git repositories to and have an URL pointing to your applications running somewhere. The fact that this could be done *for free* has made Heroku an essential part to my programming journey. I used to have no credit cards and no money to pay for services with VPS or custom domains, so Heroku's free tier was utterly important.

I could not imagine how I would be able to make such blog like this and understand the web as I am now without Heroku.

Recently, however, Heroku decided to shutdown their free tier due to exploits from people who don't want to learn from this platform. They would take advatage of the free cost to mine bitcoins, moneros and whatever. Even worse, some ultilize this tool for torrenting pornography. They would do literally everything but learn to use the site the way it is intended.

To me, this is very sad, as there are genuine people out there wanting to develop their knowledge in programming but lack the funds like me. Many potential seekers would in turn be stopped from making free and quick applications. I know that Heroku sunsetting their free service would by no mean the end of the world but knowing that my potential projects could be hindered is something to take in mind. Personally, the nostalgia with Heroku is what makes me feel sad the most about this event, I guess I may have to find another free service in place of the good ol Heroku then :^).
