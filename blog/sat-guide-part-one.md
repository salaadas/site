## Disclosure

This writing is just one of many guides to tackling the SAT. In general, you should take the information here with a grain of salt. The <span style="color:red">SAT</span> is intentionally challenging for a reason, thus you should dedicate enough time for learning & practice.

Secondly, I feel comfortable conveying my idea through informal writing, as I think it will help get the point across easier, so bear in mind. Thank you and hope you enjoy what I have to offer today :)).

## Highly useful resources

These are what I have learnt from and would highly encourage you to download and read from if you are new to the SAT. But feel free to study from other sources as these may not be suitable for everyone.

**<ins>Math:</ins>**
- [*College Panda's SAT Math*](https://libgen.is/book/index.php?md5=D4B9323640AD6BBBA69C9B64458C104D): Most <span style="color:red">important</span> when starting out
- [College Panda's 10 SAT Math Practice Tests](https://libgen.is/book/index.php?md5=E01DDB7A52BFB19B29CE733C993CF4E8): Great supplemetary material
- [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/): The prompt get repetitive if done many times

**<ins>Writing:</ins>**
- [College Panda's Writing Guide and Workbook](https://libgen.is/book/index.php?md5=C29D76A45ADE12D6372526AD1550FDB7): The only book I have read and I don't think I am lacking behind when doing full tests
- There are other recommendations such as that from **Erica Metzer**. Many praise it but I haven't gotten the time/urge to fully read through it.

**<ins>Reading:</ins>**

Reading is to me, the hardest section in the whole test, as it requires my full concentration as well as critical thinking throughout the section. Don't be fooled thinking the Reading section in SAT is similar to that in **IELTS**. It <span style="color:red">IS NOT</span>, so your way of tackling it should also be different.

The main concern I have with many **SAT Reading Guide Books** is that they don't cover how you should think through the passages and the knowledge needed in order to excel at reading comprehension.

*Because of this, I would only recommend learning SAT Reading as follows:*

- Familiarize yourself with the structures of passages and questions, learn the basic techniques of Elimination and Inferring. This [Khan Academy's Guide](https://www.khanacademy.org/test-prep/sat/sat-reading-writing-practice) will give you the taste of that.

- Learn new vocabs daily. Use [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) and download [this deck](https://thecollegepanda.com/memorize-the-top-400-sat-words-without-frustration/) for learning new words. Additionally, the [Powerscore Vocabs](https://www.powerscore.com/sites/default/files/2022-01/Repeat-Offenders-Vocabulary.pdf) is also very useful.

- Read news daily, from sciences to politics and even Corona viruses :))). Many online presses require signups or even subscriptions (Personally, I hate both of the above), but still, there are a few that I enjoy reading from. Including: [WIRED](https://www.wired.com/), [Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/), [NatGeo](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/). Please do me a favor and check out [this list](https://thecriticalreader.com/sat-act-reading-prep-resources/) for more reading prep resources.

- Make time for doing practice tests (or real tests if short on time). Do at least 2 - 3 tests weekly after comfortable with the overall structures and questioning of the SAT. And please, please, take time analyzing the wrong questions afterwards.
