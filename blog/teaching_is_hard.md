## Prologue

I did not came to this conclusion whimsically; instead, it is after I have taught over 5 people, all of whom are younger than me, that I led to this affirmation.

Just like fire, there must be timber that sparks things up. This afternoon, I spent 3 hours trying to coax my sister into reading what the Python IDLE is. She did, but with resistance. I tried to be a patient partner and cracked jokes while so. That didn't help. What exacerbate the situation more was when we decided to call mom. Here's how things went the way it did.

## Storyline

Three days ago I asked my sister to learn programming with me. Truth be told, I was hooked on the game I'm making that I forgot almost everything else, including my promise to teach her Python. I'm sorry, and I mean it whole-heartedly. Well, I thought I would make amends for what I did and propose another learning session today. Fortunately, she agreed. I did not think heavy over it at the time, but now I'm writing this blog, it was indeed abnormal of her.

*"Maybe she did liked programming after all?"*

*"Would she still likes it after today's madness?"*

Frankly, I don't know; what I know is that the story then goes like this. At around a quarter to 3 in the afternoon, she got downstairs, after cleaning up her room.

*"(Sigh) I have yet to clean mine still...."*

Anyways, we did learned something. What I did not expect was that for the majority of time, she was nibbing on her guava. I was totally fine with that, until she started screaming to my ears. I was not infuriated; I was not angry; I was not incensed either; I was simply hopeless; the situation was unprecedented. Being a calm person of mine, I started teaching anyways. Unbeknown to me, the more I explained things; the worsen she became.

*"Don't you think your sister was just playing around? She surely did not mean to do anything."*

*"I know, I know, and I was fine with it. If only she did not get angry out of a sudden..."*

Yes, I thought we were having a good time. We were just laughing around and for a moment I could not sit appropriately but fell to the ground. That was how things went. We even called mom and chasing around the house like we were 5 again. *All of a sudden,* she got angry. And I could not figured out why. I did my part and apologized for the whole thing. Maybe I was the catalyst in making her furious; or maybe I was too "kind" and gave too much attention to her while she was reading the book (it was [this](https://inventwithpython.com/invent4thed/)). Whatever it was, I apologized in hope that the state of affairs got better.

To my sister, who probably is still mad at me, I'm truly sorry and I wish you don't take things heavily on me. I did not mean what you may be angry at. And I wish we could still programming together after this.

Yours sincerely
