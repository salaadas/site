**UNLIKE THE LAST** time, today I baked alone; though there was assistance from my mom and my sister at the very end.

Weighting flour, extracting yolks, softening butter. Hands spinning while keeping close track on the consistency and thickness of the mixture. I stood for 2 hours without feeling any strains on my leg. Maybe the extensive marathon training really did something after all? That was at 8:30, and it is currently minutes before my bed time.

Over the counter, there are members of the Catholic community gathering around, forming almost a circle, to share a piece of their story from the past week. They do this *Maisonnese* every Tuesday. But why do all of this when exams are billowing in waves. Well, I must tell you that tomorrow is a special day. Thus I, who was assigned the task of baking, needed to fulfill my duty.

The 8th of March stands out from the rest because it is dedicated to honoring women worldwide. Its main focal point is to remind us about gender equality and women rights in the male-dominant society. On behalf of my friends, I wish all female readers of this blog a joyful day!

But I digress, as the topic of this blog is to reflect on my experience making cookies and outline what I did during the process. According to the article from [Savory Days](http://www.savourydays.com/cach-lam-banh-quy-so-co-la-chip-cong-thuc-moi/), the time it would take at most is 30 minutes. I, however, spent roughly over two hours and a half. I felt that my stir is more consistent, and I had a better hang on things this time. Also, I learned to get the yolks without hampering its delicate bubble, maybe I should become a chef rather than a computer engineer? **Ahaa!**

Our school allowed us to stay at home today, due to the high number of students attending the exam to determine a few of the best ones from the cities. Which is fortunate for me, as I'm currently preparing for a test at the end of March. Despite this, I'm still doing competitive programming. Today I did the *UVA Borrowers* problem. The prompt was tricky, and so is the solution. I'll brief it in case anyone is interested in knowing:

You are the librarian, your task is to audit the borrows and returns of books, and you need to rearrange the books after all the modifications to the shelves are done. **Given a set of books and a set of commands, print out the instructions for sorting the books?**

I really want to explain my solution to the above prompt, but I guess I must save that for another time. See you tomorrow daily blog! Second day in a row!

Super excited for the next blog,

Thuc
